Hey hey! This is my Gesture Blitz project, created using Electron + React.

Licence:
  This project was created as a free tool for artists, as such you can modify, use and distribute any part of this project, but only for non-commercial goals.

To test the project you first need to create a production build by using yarn run build and after that run "yarn run electron ." in console, or alternatively, you can go to main.js and switch from openFile to openUrl and put localhost 3000 in the url (React default URL when hosting locally) and then run "yarn run electron:serve" in console. 

Pro tip: you can use arrow keys to switch pics, spacebar to pause/play and Backspace to return to main menu.
